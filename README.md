# YashChavanWeb - Compiler Construction Tools

This repository showcases a collection of scripts and resources designed to implement basic components of a compiler. The focus is on **macro processing**, **lexical analysis**, **parsing**, **intermediate code generation**, and **code optimization**. 

Each script in this repository implements a core part of the compilation process, offering examples, explanations, and code snippets. These tools are ideal for anyone looking to learn about or implement foundational concepts in compiler construction.

## **Contents**

- **01_pass1_macro_processor.py**: Implements the first pass of a macro processor.
- **02_pass2_macro_processor.py**: Implements the second pass of a macro processor.
- **03_lexical_analyzer.py**: Implements a lexical analyzer to tokenize source code.
- **04_shift_reduce_parser.py**: Implements a shift-reduce parser for syntax analysis.
- **05_intermediate_code.py**: Generates intermediate code representation of the source program.
- **06_code_optimization.py**: Implements basic code optimization techniques.
- **notes.txt**: Contains additional explanations, theory, and examples for understanding the implemented tools.
- **viva_prep.txt**: A compilation of notes for viva preparation.

## **Usage**

Run each script sequentially to simulate different stages of the compilation process:
    ```bash
    python 01_pass1_macro_processor.py
    python 02_pass2_macro_processor.py
    python 03_lexical_analyzer.py
    python 04_shift_reduce_parser.py
    python 05_intermediate_code.py
    python 06_code_optimization.py
    ```

Review **notes.txt** and **viva_prep.txt** for more theoretical background and additional examples.
